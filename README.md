# Rail Telemetry Dashboard

## Overview
The Rail Telemetry Dashboard is a full-stack web application that simulates real-time monitoring of locomotive telemetry data, such as speed and fuel levels. Inspired by real-world IoT systems in the rail industry, this project demonstrates my ability to build modern, data-driven applications with a responsive UI and real-time updates. It showcases skills in frontend development, backend architecture, and database management, making it a standout addition to my portfolio.

## Why This Project?
This project reflects my experience at Wabtec Locomotive, where I gained insight into rail systems, and translates it into a technical solution relevant to industries like transportation, logistics, and IoT. Unlike typical portfolio projects (e.g., to-do apps), it tackles complex challenges like real-time data visualization and anomaly detection, highlighting my readiness for roles in software development, QA, or business analysis.

## Features
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Displays live locomotive metrics (speed, fuel) using interactive line charts.
- **Metric Filtering**: Allows users to view all metrics or focus on specific ones (e.g., speed only).
- **Anomaly Alerts**: Automatically highlights critical events, such as speed exceeding 120 km/h.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile with a clean, intuitive UI.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vue.js (3) for a reactive UI, Chart.js for data visualization, Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for robust APIs, Socket.io for real-time updates.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for efficient storage and querying of telemetry data.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend).

## What I Learned
- Building a full-stack application with real-time data handling using Socket.io.
- Designing interactive, user-friendly visualizations with Chart.js and Vue.js.
- Managing structured data with PostgreSQL, optimized for high-frequency telemetry.
- Deploying a scalable app with modern cloud platforms (Render, Vercel).
- Applying domain knowledge from the rail industry to create a practical, industry-relevant solution.

## Future Enhancements
- Add user authentication with JWT for secure access.
- Integrate a machine learning model for predictive maintenance alerts.
- Enable data export as CSV or PDF for reporting.
